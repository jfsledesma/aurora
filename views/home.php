						<p class="has-text-justified">Established in 2016, the Aurora Foundation was formed by a team of passionate, creative individuals dedicated to raising the quality of life in indigent and calamity-hit communities by developing their human capital. As an organization, Aurora also helps develop supplementary programs for other advocacies that share in its vision, acting as a support backbone for a network of organizations devoted to combating inequality of social development.</p>

				<h3>VISION</h3>
					<p>Avanzare Aurora believes in a world where all individuals, regardless of initial social strata, can guarantee themselves a sustainable means of livelihood, education, and self-development.</p>
				<h3>MISSION</h3>
					<p class="has-text-centered">Break the poverty cycle by investing in human capital.</p>

					<p> Poverty isn’t just physical – it’s also psychological, social and intellectual. We address the lack of development that individuals have in those areas, which keeps them in the poverty cycle.</p>
				<h3>PHILOSOPHY</h3>
				<p class="has-text-centered">Human Capital Development</p>
				<p>We define <strong>human capital</strong>, quite loosely, as the sum total of opportunities an individual experiences for their personal development. This consists of things like education, vocational training, physical and psychological wellness, life skills, and similar intangibles. Based on numerous studies, human capital is a major factor in the growth and success of a community, which is why we have made <strong>investing in human capital development</strong> the central objective of our organization. All our efforts either directly address obstacles to said development, or else call attention to communities in order to attract stakeholders who may be better able to provide resources said individuals and communities need.</p>
